To start a game, the dealer deals two cards to his opponent, then leaves two open cards on the table and finally two is dealt to him, and deals another round of cards as in the first. This means that each player will have four cards in his hand and there will be four face up on the table. The giver places the deck on the right and the game begins. After these hands are played, the dealer deals four cards to each player, two at a time, but does not put any on the table. It continues in this way, the same dealer deals hands of four cards each, six consecutive times, until the deck runs out, but puts cards on the table only at the beginning. When there are more than two players, each receives four cards in each round, but none are put on the table before the first round. When dealing the last cards of the deck, the dealer must announce "Last round". The turn to give alternates, or passes clockwise.
